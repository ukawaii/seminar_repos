	<h3>Tere tulemast!</h3>
	<p>"Who’s joe?" a distant voice asks.<br>

Instantly everyone nearby hears the sound of 1,000s of bricks rapidly shuffling towards his location.<br>

The earth itself seemed to cry out in agony, until finally the ground itself split open and a horrific creature crawled from the ground, covered in mucus and tar.<br>

”Joe Momma…” the creature whispered.<br>

The man cried out in pain as he disintegrated into dust, and the whole world fell silent in fear.<br>

"I did a little trolling." the wretched creature remarked before burrowing back into the earth.</p>
